# Use cases

Zeus has been built to cater to users on each end of the bitcoin experience spectrum. From users who just want a simple way to make fast, cheap payments. To lightning node operators who want fine-tuned control over how they make payments. Zeus can be the bitcoin experience you want it to be.

A goal of Zeus is to start users out with a trust-minimized, basic user experience and over time encourage users to upgrade their sovereignty within the application by cutting ties with any trusted third-parties Zeus may use within it's application. We call this principle progressive sovereignty. The best outcome being moving from a basic payments app to running and managing their own Lightning node using Zeus. We understand not everyone will take this path but if we can help even one user become completely sovereign with their bitcoin payments than that's a win.

## [Node operators](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus-docs/blob/main/docs/node-operators.md)

If you run your own LND, c-lightning, or Eclair Lightning node you can remotely connect to and manage it with Zeus.

## [Merchants](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus-docs/blob/main/docs/merchants.md)

Merchants using BTCPay Server or LNBits can connect to Zeus and manage their stores payments. We will also be offering a merchants profile alongside our mobile node that will turn Zeus into a portable, non-custodial POS system.

## [Payments](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus-docs/blob/main/docs/payments.md) (Coming 2022)

Coming in late 2022 Zeus will be implementing a local mobile Lightning node connected to our own Zeus Lightning Service Provider (LSP). This will enable a simple interface for making fast and cheap bitcoin payments without having to worry about lightning channel management.

## [Savings](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus-docs/blob/main/docs/cold-storage.md) (Coming 2022)

Zeus is currently working on integrating external signer support. This will allow you to make payments, manage your bitcoin on-chain savings, and for node operators, open channels from an external signer.
